## Prerequisites:
**Windows: Your computer must have Java and the latest version of Google Chrome installed**
**Linux: Currently onlu GNOME is supported. Your computer must have the following packages installed:**
```
  wget
  grep
  cut
  html-xml-utils
  cron
```

===================================================================================

If you want to edit the source code, take note that it is the BrowserTest.java file...
The .jar files are simply the dependencies that BrowserTest.java needs in order to execute...

===================================================================================

## For Windows...

Once you clone or extract this to the required directory, simply run the BingBG_Downloader.bat file to
download today's Bing wallpaper. By default, it will be saved in your Pictures folder. If you do not want
to see the terminal window, you can run the BingBG_Downloader_HIDDEN.vbs file, and that's it!!

***NOTE:*** **If Windows shows a Security Prompt, click on _More info_ and run it. Trust me guys, this is not a malware...
If you are still unsure though, you may upload the file(s) to https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home and see for yourself...**

###### (Optional)
You can create a shortcut of the BingBG_Downloader_HIDDEN.vbs file and then copy it and paste it in
your startup folder to run this program at startup and thus download Bing wallpapers daily...
In order to access your startup folder, simply press ***Windows Key + R*** on your keyboard to get the Run
Dialog box and there, type:
```
shell:startup
```
Once the folder opens, paste BingBG_Downloader_HIDDEN.vbs and now you should be good to go.

## For Linux...
Only supporing gnome distros right now
Once you clone or extract this to the required directory, open a terminal there and run:
```
bash BingDownloaderLinux_86
```
**NOTE: The cron part is still in beta, it is experimental, and may not work. It will be patched in future releases.**
